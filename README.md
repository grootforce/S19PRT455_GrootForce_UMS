## Workflow:
The repository setup that this project use and that works well with the branching model, is that with a central “truth” repo. Its a centralised workflow model where each developer pulls and pushes to origin without creating any peers to peers workflow to form sub teams. The branching model it follows are:

### The main branch
* **Master branch**
* **Develop branch**

### Supporting Branch
The supporting branch may branch from develop branch and should merge to develop branch. The supporting branch includes
* **Feature branches:** The feature branch follows following naming convension which starts with feature-* and * is the name of the feature.
* **Hotfix branches:** The hotfix branch is for the error fixing during some iterations when bugs from other iteration may come up. The naming is as similar to the feature branch.
* **Release branches**
