## Workflow:
The repository setup that this project use and that works well with the branching model, is that with a central “truth” repo. Its a centralised workflow model where each developer pulls and pushes to origin without creating any peers to peers workflow to form sub teams. The branching model it follows are:

### The main branch
Markup : * Master branch
        * Develop branch

### Supporting Branch
The supporting branch may branch from develop branch and should merge to develop branch. The supporting branch includes
Markup : * Feature branches
        * Hotfix branches
        * Release branches
